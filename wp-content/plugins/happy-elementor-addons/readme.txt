### **UNIQUE PRO FEATURES OF HAPPY ADDONS TO WATCH OUT FOR**

The premium (PRO) features of Happy Addons truly make it stand out from all the other Elementor add-ons out there right now. You will get the below mentioned much talked about standout premium features in the PRO version of Happy Addons:

### **CROSS-DOMAIN COPY-PASTE: APPLY THE SAME DESIGN TO MULTIPLE DOMAINS WITH A SINGLE CLICK**

If you are creating different web pages with WordPress, you will often try to use the same elements of a web page to other pages over and over again.

To address this issue, the Elementor page builder comes with a free copy and paste elements feature for a single domain. But the problem is, you can not copy and paste an element to other domains.

This is where the goodness of the Happy Addons comes to the rescue! With this tool, you can copy and paste any element (for example, buttons, navigation bars, carousel, accordion, etc.) from one domain to another domain. Cool, right?

[Watch Demo](https://demo.happyaddons.com/cross-domain-copy-paste/)

### **PRESET: SAVE YOUR TIME AND EFFORT BY USING THE PRESET FEATURE**

If you try to create your website from scratch and give it a professional appearance, then it will take up a huge amount of time and effort.

To tackle this hassle, the Preset option of the Happy Addons comes into play! Much like its name, it will let you select pre-made designs to create a web page faster and of course without compromising the quality. Currently, there are 400+ preset designs available in Happy Addons.

[Watch Demo](https://demo.happyaddons.com/presets-demo/)

### **UNLIMITED SECTION NESTING: USE UNLIMITED SECTION NESTING TO GO BEYOND THE LIMIT**

With Elementor, you can create sections to make room for elements. We feel happy to say that by integrating the Happy Elementor add-ons, you can create infinite sections within a single section.

And as usual, you can insert as many widgets as you want into those sections.

[Watch demo](https://demo.happyaddons.com/unlimited-section-nesting/)

### **LIVE COPY: COPY DESIGNS FROM DEMO SITE TO GET IT DONE RIGHT AWAY!**

Sometimes you may wish to simulate exactly the same design that you see on our demo page. Amazingly, with the Live Copy option, you can do it at your disposal.

This is a go-to way that lets you copy the code of the demo design from the demo site and allows you to use it directly on your Elementor edit panel.

Unlike a theme template, using the demo designs won't put any pressure on your media server which is a must-have to help load the page faster.
